# MathHammer
A javascript application to calculate 40k average damage

## How to use this calculator:
* Go to https://wahapedia.ru/ (or use the quick faction links in the Mathhammer page, within Wahapedia the skull icon in the bottom-right will show individual units' pages).
* Find a unit, copy the statblock or the whole page and paste it in the appropriate box. Then click calculate!
* You can also adjust the number in each unit, the to-hit and to-wound modifiers and whether the weapon is half-range or not. The calculator assumes all models are firing at the same target, so if you have a unit with multiple weapons it will calculate the average of all the weapons' stats.
* Note that this calculator is meant for quick comparisons and may not be 100% accurate in all cases, especially for units with special rules that affect their stats or weapons, but I've done my best include all the generic ones.
* For unsupported special rules that affect a specific stat (for example AP), you can edit the models' and weapons' stats directly before calculating.
